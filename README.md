## Description
Creatinging a single-page application that displays samples of my work that have deployed via React. (Challenge 20)

Once again, this project has pushed me along the way.  I have learned a lot more, have been able to study up and understand more about ways to link items and pages together. I've also figured out that using React is actaully very user friendly, once you understand what you're doing.

### User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

* WHEN I load the portfolio
* THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* WHEN I view the header
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

* WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

* WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

* WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

* WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
* THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
* THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
* WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
* THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

* WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

* WHEN I enter text into the email address field
* THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
* WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

* WHEN I view the footer
* THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```
